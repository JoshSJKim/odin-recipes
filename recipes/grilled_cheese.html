<figcaption>A quick fix for anyone hungry - Grilled Cheese</figcaption>

<h3>Description</h3>
  <p>My personal favourite "snack". Okay. To be honest. It's not a snack, but it's not a meal. I like to make this whenever I feel peckish, but don't have the energy to cook something from scratch.</p>
  <p>There are many different styles of grilled cheese, but this is my favourite.</p>
  <p>Crisp on the outside, gooey on the inside. So simple, yet so satisfying. Let get grillin'.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 slices of bread</li>
    <li>Butter</li>
    <li>Cheeses of your choice, at least one kind must be shredded</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat up a skillet. I like to use my cast iron pan.</li>
    <li>Add a generous amount of butter in the center, and throw a handful of shredded cheese on top of the butter.</li>
    <p>Note: You could use any type of cheese. But dry cheese (like parmesan) or high moisture content cheese (like mozzarella) may not work very well. I like to use a Mexican blend shredded cheese. You can buy the shredded kind, or you could grate it yourself. Shredded cheese is for the outside of the bread. I use sliced cheese for the inside. Usually a combination of Monterey Jack and marble or cheddar.</p>
    <li>Throw on a slice of bread on top of the melting cheese, followed by a slice of Monterey Jack and marble (or cheddar). You could throw on some more shredded cheese to 'fill in the gaps'. Cover with the other slice of bread.</li>
    <p>Note: You could use any type of loaf. But I prefer to use sourdough loaves, just for digestive purposes. Sourdough rye provides a nice crisp texture and it has a nice flavour to it.</p>
    <li>When the cheese on the bottom is nice, crisp, golden brown, remove from the skillet/pan for a minute.</li>
    <li>Add more butter and shredded cheese in the center. Flip the grilled cheese and let it do its thing on the 'unfinished' side of the sandwich.</li>
    <li>Grill until crisp golden brown.</li>
    <li>Remove from skillet and cut diagonally.</li>
    <li>Pairs nicely with soup or puree.</li>
  </ol>
