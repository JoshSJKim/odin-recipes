<h3>Description</h3>
  <p>My personal favourite "snack". Okay. To be honest. It's not a snack, but it's not a meal. I like to make this whenever I feel peckish, but don't have the energy to cook something from scratch.</p>
  <p>There are many different styles of grilled cheese, but this is my favourite.</p>
  <p>Crisp on the outside, gooey on the inside. Let get grillin'</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 slices of bread</li>
    <li>Butter</li>
    <li>Cheeses of your choice, at least one kind must be shredded</li>
