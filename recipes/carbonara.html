    <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>It is a shame that most 'North-Americanized' recipes for Carbonara use cream to achieve the creamy texture of this beloved Italian dish.</p>
      <p>This authentic recipe does not use cream. It is very simple to make with only a few ingredients.</p>
      <p>Let's get started.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>EVOO</li>
        <li>Pasta of choice (I prefer linguine or spaghetti)</li>
        <li>5 Eggs</li>
        <li>Grated grana padano cheese (At least 1 cup, may be substituted with grated parmesan)</li>
        <li>Guanciale - Italian cured meat using pork jowl or cheek (May be substituted with bacon, but use guanciale if possible)</li>
        <li>Ground black pepper</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add salt in the water to bring pasta to taste.</li>
        <li>Add dry pasta to the boiling water. Cook pasta until 'al dente' (follow instructions on packaging for time)</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat a large pan, add generous amount of olive oil.</li>
        <li>Dice up the pancetta (or bacon) and cook until crisp golden brown. (Turn off heat when fully cooked)</li>
        <li>While the pasta and pancetta are cooking, add 5 eggs to a large bowl. You may separate the egg white and the yolk, and just use the yolk for a thicker texture, but I usually add the whole egg.</li>
        <li>Add grated cheese (grana padano or parmesan) and generous amount of ground black pepper</li>
        <li>whisk all together until all ingredients are well mixed, with a thick, runny texture.</li>
        <li>Once the pasta is cooked, drain the water (save about a cup for use if necessary) and add the pasta to the pan with the pancetta.</li>
        <li>Mix well so that the pasta is coated in the pancetta oil, and let it cool for a little bit (If the pasta is too hot, the egg mixture will get cooked, resulting in a dry, scrambled egg texture)</li>
        <li>When the pasta has cooled down a bit, slowly add in the egg mixture and mix well, making sure that the egg mixture gives a nice coat to the pasta with the oil.</li>
        <li>If the pasta seems too dry, add some of the pasta water that was previously saved.</li>
      </ol>
