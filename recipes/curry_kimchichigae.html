<h3>Description</h3>

  <p>Kimchi is a part of every Korean meal. It is merely a sidedish, but it's at the heart of every Korean cuisine.</p>
  <p>Koreans also love curry, and for some reason, fermented dishes pair wonderfully with curry, especially kimchi.</p>
  <p>Let's prepare this traditional Korean favourite with a little twist.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Kimchi (nappa cabbage)</li>
    <li>Ottogi Korean style curry</li>
    <li>Mushrooms</li>
    <li>Zucchini</li>
    <li>Pork (belly, I prefer shoulder)</li>
    <li>Tofu (firm)</li>
    <li>Sesame oil</li>
    <li>Sugar</li>
    <li>Green onions, sesame (for garnishing)</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Prepare a kettle with boiling water.</li>
    <li>Prepare your veggies (any kind of mushroom of your choice, Zucchini) by dicing it into thumb sized pieces.</li>
    <li>Prepare the pork and tofu (slice the pork belly into preferred thickness, I like 'em thick, or if using shoulder, make bite-sized cubes. It's all preference. Same goes for tofu)</li>
    <li>Thinly chop green onions for garnishing.</li>
    <li>Heat a pot or deep pan of your choice on low heat and add 2tbsp of sesame oil and stir-fry the kimchi.</li>
    <p>Note: Kimchichigae is best made when the kimchi is well fermented. It's preferable to get your hands on homemade kimchi rather than store bought. If it doesn't seem fermented enough, leave the kimchi out in room temperature overnight. The more pungent it is, the better.</p>
    <li>In the pan (or pot), move the kimchi to the side and throw in the pork. Pour some kimchi brine over it (You could marinade the pork in the kimchi brine for deeper flavour). Add a few pinches of sugar to the pork (It helps the meat absorb the flavor better)</li>
    <li>Add the prepared veggies and keep stir-frying.</li>
    <li>Add in 2 heaping spoons of Ottogi Korean style curry powder and stir-fry until the ingredients are well coated.</li>
    <li>When the kimchi, pork, and veggies appear to be mingling well together, slowly pour in some hot water, little bit at a time, stirring occasionally.</li>
    <li>The ingredients should not be submerged in water. When the water level meats the ingredients top level, add the tofu and cover the pot/pan and bring to a boil.</li>
    <li>Garnish with green onions and sesame. Enjoy over hot rice.</li>
  </ol>
